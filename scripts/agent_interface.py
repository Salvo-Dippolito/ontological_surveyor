This module contains the classes called to interface the finite state machine node with the action clients and topics related 
to the robot agent moving in the armor ontology. 

The class ActionClientHelper has been taken as is from this repository: https://github.com/buoncubi/arch_skeleton

class ActionClientHelper:

    Class constructor, i.e., class initializer. Input parameters are:

    - `service_name`: it is the name of the server that will be invoked by this client.

    - `action_type`: it is the message type that the server will exchange

    - `done_callback`: it is the name of the function called when the action server completed its computation. If
      this parameter is not set (i.e., set to `None`), then only the `self._done_callback` function will be
      called when the server completes its computation.

    - `feedback_callback`: it is the name of the function called when the action server sends a feedback message. If
      this parameter is not set (i.e., set to `None`), then only the `self._feedback_callback` functions will be
      called when the server sends a feedback message.

    - `mutex`: it is a `Lock` object synchronised with the `done_callback` and `feedback_callback`. If it is not set
      (i.e., set to `None`), then a new mutex instance is considered. Set this variable if you want to extends the
      synchronization with other classes.
